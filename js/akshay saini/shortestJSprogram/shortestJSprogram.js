//still js will create a Global execution, you can debug and get it, in JS this, window, global are all same things which are the top level code 
//so if i console log this or window it will create an object provide by js which has many apis 
console.log(this)
// var x = 10 
// console.log(x)
// console.log(this.x) //both of this will print the value of x as it is in the top level but any nested values ie inside functions etc cant be printed directly 
// console.log(window.x)

//so the shortest function is js is nothing!
