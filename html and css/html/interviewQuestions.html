5. What are Semantic Elements?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

    Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

        In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  
        
        <article>
        <aside>
        <details>
        <figcaption>
        <figure>
        <footer>
        <header>
        <main>
        <mark>
        <nav>
        <section>
        <summary>
        <time>

6. Lists and types
HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.

there are three types of lists
1. unordered list

    The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:
        
2. ordered list

3. Description lists.

A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.    
The <dl> tag defines the description list, the <dt> tag defines the term (name), and the <dd> tag describes each term:

7. What is HTML Web Storage?
 With web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser.
    
 Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.

 HTML web storage provides two objects for storing data on the client:

window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date
window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)

8. void elements
A void element cannot have any content but may have attributes. Void elements are self-closing, so they must not have a closing tag.

In HTML5, the following elements are void:

area
base
br
col
embed
hr
img
input
keygen
link
meta
param
source
track
wbr

9. where should we place script in html in top (head) or in bottom(body)
one should always place script after the content has loaded ie in the bottom if we place on top and suppose we had event listener onload that does something so it wont be able to do it as it will first get loaded and then the html so always use script in the bottom
